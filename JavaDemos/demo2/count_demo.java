        loop that will continuously increment values until they reach maximum.
        
        It is a good time to explain how these data types work to store integers.
        The range of values for each data type are such that half are negative
        and the other half are made of 0 and positive.
        
        The concept is implemented using a counting system known as two's 
        complement and is beyond the scope of this exercise.*/
